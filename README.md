## Summary

---------------------

Just a simple grade calculator in a minimalist format.

## Description

---------------------

> I wanted to make something more minimalistic that is easy to navigate. There are many grade calculators that have too much going on and some can be out of date in terms of overall look on the website. I wanted to get bakc to basics and make a project using plain CSS, HTML, and JS.

## Instalation 

------------------

1. First clone the repo in your terimnal

    ``` bash
    git clone repo.git
    ```

2. navigate to where you coloned the repo and open the code in you IDE.

    I use [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. Open in Live Server/ Default Browser

4. Get Calculating!

## Usage

---------------------

1. Scroll down the inputs to input the grades that you wish to calculate.

2. Click the calculate button to calculate the total grades.

3. Either choose to save the class or it will not be saved.

4. You can revist saved classes by clicking on the My Classes.
